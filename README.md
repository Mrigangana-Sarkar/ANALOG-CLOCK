# Analog-clock-using-OpenCV

Computer vision project implemented with OpenCV

Here in this project we will use the concepts of Trigonometry and Computer Vision along with the capabilities of python to develop a analog running watch.


Analog Clock Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates the creation of a real-time analog clock using Python and OpenCV. The clock features a graphical user interface displaying the current time with dynamically rotating hour, minute, and second hands.

Features

Real-time analog clock with rotating hands.

Hour, minute, and second hands update every second.

Uses OpenCV to render the clock face and handle graphical elements.


Installation

To run the project, you need Python and OpenCV installed. You can install OpenCV via pip.

How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.


2. Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed.


3. Run the script to display the analog clock in a new window.



Project Overview

OpenCV for Graphics: The project utilizes OpenCV to draw the clock face, hands, and dynamically update them.

Time Management: The clock synchronizes with the system time, ensuring the hands represent the correct current time.

Mathematical Calculations: Trigonometry is used to determine the position of the hands based on the current time.


Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV

Numpy (optional, for advanced calculations)
